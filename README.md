# Learning C++

<img width="148" height="148" alt="C++ Logo" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e84e0e62-b12f-4121-9bef-d730809ed506" />

I decided to start learning a new programming language, and after some search, I chose **C++**.  
This language is widely used around the world and is known for its power in solving algorithmic problems.  
By learning C++, I hope to strengthen my problem-solving and algorithmic thinking skills.  

Another goal that motivates me is to participate in the **International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI)** in the future, which makes mastering C++ an essential step on my journey.

I created this repository to document everything I learn and keep it organized by priority.  
Lately, I’ve been feeling a bit lazy, so sharing my progress on GitHub and making it public will motivate me to take learning more seriously and stay focused.

I’m using [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com) as my main resource for learning C++.  
It’s a free website that explains C++ concepts in text, and since I enjoy learning through reading, it’s a perfect fit for me.

My goal is to become strong in problem-solving and algorithmic thinking, and eventually compete in the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI).
