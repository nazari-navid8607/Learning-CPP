## I think the method I was using to learn C++ was wrong

When I was learning C++, I spent a lot of time writing documents and READMEs about what I learned each day, how things worked, and explaining the concepts I had just studied. This took too much of my time and stopped me from focusing on the main goal: actually learning the C++ language.

From now on, I want to take a different approach. First, I’ll study the material according to the plan I’ve set for myself. Then, I’ll write a few practice programs to apply what I’ve learned. I’ll also write a short note about what I studied that day, which parts I used in my programs, and any ideas that came to mind.

Because my main goal here isn’t teaching C++ or writing documentation—my main goal in this repository is to learn the language, write code, and practice.

## What I learned today

I learned how to create strings in both traditional c way `char arr[]{"value"};`(which I know that before) and the new method `std::string name{"initialization value"};`. requiers `#include <string>`.

I also learnt how to make a file and write in it. I was thinking, can I make a code which asks for name and email of a user and save them in a database? and I created [Email_Saver_Program](EmailSaverProgram/) dir and wrote`SaveUserInfo.cpp` which saves info in `info.csv`.

I learnt a trick, in c++ we can store different values in same name of variable using namespaces. [my code](NamespacePractice/namespace_practice.cpp)

I also wanted to get more familiar with functions in C++, thus, I tried to make a classic game for this concept ([guess the number](GuessTheNumber/GuessTheNumberGame/GuessTheNumber.cc)). I also got familiar with how to get random numbers, how to use sleep method and how to make loops in C++ thanks to that program, so I decided to go furter, therefore I made an [app](MatrixGenerator/MatrixGenerator.cpp) that makes matric using for loop.
